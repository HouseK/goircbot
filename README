Go IRC Bot
----------

Acquire and build:
  $ go get github.com/StalkR/goircbot

It may fail with errors because goircbot is based on fluffle/goirc master
branch but default branch is go1. Solution:
  $ cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/fluffle/goirc"
  $ git checkout master
  $ git pull
  $ cd -
  $ go get github.com/StalkR/goircbot

Root directory is for "package main" and contains an example bot.
`bot` directory contains the package itself.
Plugins are available in `plugins`, inspire from them to create new plugins.
Libraries are available in `lib` for use in plugins.
